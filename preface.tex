This course is based on notes for a financial derivatives trading course. The intention in these notes is to be as brief as possible without substantially compromising depth. It would be ideal for all students of finance to first develop a substantial mathematical background and approach the subject at the highest level of generality, but this is not practical. Fortunately the main concepts can be developed quite simply through examples.
