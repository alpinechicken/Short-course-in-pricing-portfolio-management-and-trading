Much of the capitalist economy is funded on credit. Each different borrower, in each different currency, for loans of different lengths of time, borrows on different terms. Fixed  income is the study of how to price and manage these differences. 

This is a short course through theory and practice of fixed income markets in three chapters:


\textbf{Chapter 1: Pricing}: Methods for pricing different loans and combinations of loans.\\
\textbf{Chapter 2: Portfolio Management:} Methods for managing a portfolio of loans.\\
\textbf{Chapter 3: Trading:} Methods for trading loans to achieve desirable objectives.
